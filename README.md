## It's not a Bug, it's a Backdoor!

Web-based technologies allow us to develop rapidly and reach the broadest possible audience of users, but are difficult to secure and audit. Many Blockchain applications are built on web based technologies, clashing with their security critical nature and use of complex cryptographic libraries. This clash opens new avenues for underhanded tampering of our software. In this presentation, weâ€™ll discuss methods of crafting, detecting, and preventing underhanded cryptographic code in JavaScript.



## Consumer Privacy in Blockchains

Blockchains of all kinds present privacy challenges to consumers and businesses. We'll discuss some of the common forms of blockchains in 2016, common privacy pitfalls for each time, how these threats can be threat modeled, and how they can be mitigated.
